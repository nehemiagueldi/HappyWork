# HappyWork
This is a web application that generates random food dish names from a list of already registered food dishes or user input (Random Name Food Generator with CRUD Functionality). The application also allows the user to add, edit, and delete food dishes from the list. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's hosted on Github Pages.

# How it works
The user can choose to generate a random food dish name from the list of already registered dishes or add their own food dish to the list. If the user chooses to add a new dish, they can enter the dish name and click the "Add" button. The new dish will be added to the list of registered dishes, and the user can then generate a random name from the updated list.

The user can also edit or delete registered dishes by clicking the "Edit" or "Delete" button next to the dish name. If the user clicks the "Edit" button, they can update the dish name and click the "Save" or "OK" button to save the changes. If the user clicks the "Delete" button, the dish will be removed from the list of registered dishes.

The dishes are stored in the browser's local storage, which means that the data will be saved even if the user closes the browser window.
